# Story Pitch:

The story we chose to visualize is the education inequity as it has been one of the most serious problem in the world. In fact, students across the United States are facing the same issue: not every student have the equal access to quality education. Specifically, we would like to focus to scope on education inequity that happens among the high school students. By analyzing the high school graduation rate, we could tell how educational resources are distributed unevenly across the country based on the income level. Furthermore, it could give us more insights on how the quality of education affects the college enrollment rate and average SAT score for the high schools. These aspects are important to help us understand the association between education inequity and possible factors underlying behind this issue, such as socioeconomic status, races, and ethnicity. 

Generally, privileged group of people will be easier to access any academic resources they need and they are more likely to be successful. For example, high schools that are located in wealthy neighborhood provide their students with advanced coursework and technology as well as high quality educators who are experienced in teaching. Hence, they have a higher chance of getting high SAT scores and gaining admission to top university. In contrast, there is insufficient priority given for the high schools in poorer areas, causing the students to learn much less and receive less support from the classroom. As a result, they are more likely to drop out of school earlier while getting less chance of enrolling in college with the lower SAT scores. All of these make the gap in education to grow bigger and bigger. The students from low-income households, the people of color, and those who live in rural regions are disproportionately impacted by this gap and they are denied for the opportunities that should be open to everyone.

Education is not only a basic human right, it is also an inevitable factor on financial security, responsible citizenship and sustainable development. Therefore, it is crucial to have equity in education so that we could help underprivileged students to earn an equal opportunity in order for them to have a better learning environment and gain access to a brighter future. We believe our story will push the viewers to confront the systemic barrier that keep millions of students from reaching their full potential and motivates them to work towards the goal where everyone has the chance to achieve. Also, we hope to inspire the viewers to reflect and contribute on creating an equitable education system that will help those who are under-served and disadvantaged in education.
